Small proof-of-concept how [NY/Times Digits](https://www.nytimes.com/games/digits) could be solved programmatically.


## TODO:

- [ ] Tests
- [ ] fix use of duplicate values
- [ ] Look for optimal solution
- [ ] Show operations
- [ ] Add pruning

## Usage:

```
go run main.go --target 62 1 2 3 4 5 10
```
